Description: Two options are added to the 'LPE' algorithm. The original
        'LPE' method sets all variances below the max variance in the
        ordered distribution of variances to the maximum variance. in
        'LPEadj' this option is turned off by default.  The second option
        is to use a variance adjustment based on sample size rather
        than pi/2.  By default the 'LPEadj' uses the sample size based
        variance adjustment.
